# harmonychat
Just a little project to learn c#

If you choose to try this out:
1. To chat with others they have to be on the same network as you
2. The host will need to create the user for both ends (I will probably fix this later)
3. The host will need to share the folder wich has the user files stored (Roaming folder). you can open by windows key+R and then type %appdata%
And then you should be good to go :)
